### Hello! / Dobrý deň!

My name is Tom and I am a web developer and data visualization specialist with a background in political science and research. I currently work at Oliver Wyman Acturial Consulting, where I am a manager in charge of building web applications and R Shiny tools for business intelligence. I am passionate about open source and enjoy using my skills to create meaningful, creative, and impactful projects. In my previous role as a researcher at NORC at the University of Chicago, I gained valuable experience in data analysis and data engineering. 

Some of my work includes...

- R Packages used for the [COVID Impact Survey's](https://www.covid-impact.org/) [cross-tabulations](https://www.covid-impact.org/cross-tabulations) and [topline findings](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e8769b34812765cff8111f7/t/5ee11863221ddf08b0284c20/1591810150212/covid_w3_topline_national_web.pdf).
- An [R-Shiny application](https://tomasokal.shinyapps.io/dfsoptimizer/) where you can optimize DFS lineups using live and up to date web scraped data.
- An R Package, [Rtist](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rtist/index.html), available on CRAN.
